# Fish Memory App (Nativescript + Angular)
This project was generated with [Nativescript](https://www.nativescript.org/) version 3.4.3

This repo is part of the tiny project/portfolio for a **Super Simple Flash Card Management App**.

Unfortunately, I cannot make a live demo of this project as it is a native app for android and ios.

This app provides simple CRUDs for flash cards (only texts) and quizzes (group of cards). It also has a feature to play a quiz to check how good you are doing with your cramming at your exams : )

## How To Install And Run
Assuming you already followed the instructions at https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/start/quick-setup.

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependent modules
3. Run `tns run ios` for iOS platform or `tns run android` for android platform.
